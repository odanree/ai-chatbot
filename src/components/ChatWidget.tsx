/**
 * Chat Widget Component
 * 
 * This is a placeholder for the React chat widget.
 * In a full implementation, this would use:
 * - React for component state management
 * - TypeScript for type safety
 * - CSS Modules for styling
 * 
 * For now, we'll focus on the embeddable JavaScript version
 * that can be loaded from any website.
 * 
 * TODO: Create a separate frontend project (Next.js/Vite) for the React component
